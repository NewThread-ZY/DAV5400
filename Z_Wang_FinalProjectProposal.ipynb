    "### Introductionï¼šLast few years, every country has a rapid development. We always use GDP to describe a country's development but we ignore most of the valuable data which can help people to understand the development of the country better. In the final project, I would like to get some data about some development indicators of every country across the world from The World Bank Data(https://data.worldbank.org/) and GDP data from international monetary fund(INF) (https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPD@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD/AFG/CAN) to explore which indicator has a relationship with the development of a country and what's the relationship between them. For example, current health expenditure maybe has some positive relationship with GPD but we can't know the relationship exactly maybe it's linear or exponent. "

Some data not only can help people to acknowledge the development of a country but also can it help people to know which is important for a country's development such as education expenditure. Country can improve the expenditure in these fields which are ignored by people in general and maybe this project can have helped some country to develop faster and make the world better."

    "### Approach: Firstly, I will download the CSV file and upload it to Github. I will use Pandas to read it in Jupyter. Then, I will use Web API to get some data and store it in PostgreSQL. I also will get some data by Web Crawler to help get the data better. I will use the bar to see the development of this data from one year to another year. I also will use a scatter plot to see the relationship between GDP. This is large and with many missing data needs to deal and it is filled with challenges but I believe that I can do it well."
